Implementation of the assignments of [famous Stanford's graduate class for Convolutional Neural Networks, CS231n.](https://cs231n.github.io)

You can find the %99 implementation of assignments in this repo. However, code is neither written for readablity nor for efficiency. It's mission in this world is to give intuition when one is stuck at one point of assignments.

#### Disclaimer

I don't hold any right of course material. Since they are last year's assignments and every year they are changed(I guess and hope so), I publish. Can be removed if demanded. Reach out from [this page which includes my mail address](https://kirbiyik.github.io/about).
