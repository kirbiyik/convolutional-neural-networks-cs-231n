Implementation of the assignments of [Stanford's famous graduate class for Convolutional Neural Networks, CS231n.](https://cs231n.github.io)

If there is a major difference between desired results and the results obtained from code, it is likely due to the fact that at later part of assignment it challenges to increase accuracy even more. For instance, I used different weight initialization scheme to get higher accuracy which would probably change the result of earlier part of assignment. Yet, general idea should be the same, there should not be a major difference in code.

You can find the 99% of the code for assignments in this repo. However, code is neither written for readability nor for efficiency. It's mission is to give intuition when one is stuck at one point of assignments.

I don't hold any right of course material. Since they are last year's assignments and every year they are changed(I guess and hope so), I publish. Can be removed if demanded. Reach out from [this page which includes my mail address](https://kirbiyik.github.io/about).
